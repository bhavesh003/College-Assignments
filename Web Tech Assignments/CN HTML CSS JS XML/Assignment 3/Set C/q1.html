        As per Hindu mythology, Dussehra is celebrated after Navratri because it is believed that Lord Ram worshipped
        Goddess Durga before starting his journey to defeat Ravana on Lord Vishnu's advice.

    <p>Vijayadashami, also known as Dussehra,Dasara or Dashain, is a major Hindu festival celebrated at the end of
        Navaratri every year. It is observed on the tenth day in the Hindu calendar month of Ashvin, the seventh month
        of the Hindu Luni-Solar Calendar, which typically falls in the Gregorian months of September and October.

        offered to God on the day of Dussehra. Everyone wishes each other and go to the temple.I enjoy with my family on
